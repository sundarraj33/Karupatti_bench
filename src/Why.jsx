                                The processed foods industry through its subliminal marketing gimmicks has changed our food habits and has found its niche of fitting into our lifestyle with just convenience as its USP.
                                <br /> <br />
                                In this process, we have drifted away from our native-food culture &amp; eventually became the children of processed, factory-grown foods and forgotten the flavours of our land.
                                <br /> <br />
                                Its a good sign that slowly people are realizing and moving towards healthy, nutritious, high fiber foods like - Rice Kanji (Rice Porridge), Koozh (Millet Porridge), Karupatti coffee (Palm Jaggery coffee), Steamed foods and so on.,
